# Win8Synth
Windows 8 Multitouch Synth

Example for a multitouch based, windows store App. Requieres Visual Studio 2012 to compile, and also needs to have the Mono-Game library installed in your computer.

This synth is based on a symple (and buggy) oscilator, with 3 different source waves, and 3 envelope waves. Also has a envelope frecuency controller for each one.

Its used to prove the multitouch interaction in windows 8/8.1, also testing the XAudio2 audio interface, using Mono-Game
